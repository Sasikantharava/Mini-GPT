Title: The Clever Fox

Once upon a time in a lush green forest, there lived a clever fox. The fox was known far and wide for his quick wit and cunning mind.

One hot summer day, he was wandering through the woods, feeling very thirsty. He searched for water everywhere but couldn't find any. Just when he was about to give up, he saw a tall pot lying under a tree. He rushed to it and looked inside. There was some water at the bottom, but the neck of the pot was too narrow for the fox to reach it.

The clever fox sat down and thought for a moment. Then, he had an idea. He began picking up small pebbles nearby and dropping them one by one into the pot. Slowly, the water level began to rise. After a while, the water came close enough to the top, and the fox was finally able to drink.

Satisfied and refreshed, the fox walked away, proud of his clever thinking.

Moral: Where there is a will, there is a way.
